## 4. Tutorials

ðŸ’¡ For this evolution 2, you need to run **1 server** and **4 clients** (this is a fixed number at present). Each client will be assigned to one house according to the Harry Potter world setting: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw or Slytherin.

### 4.1. Start the Server

âœ… Run the server by command:
```bash
./gradlew :server:run
```
Wait for players to connect to the server. 

### 4.2. Start the Clients

âœ… To see the clientUI interface, run the clientUI configuration by clicking the triangle button.

If you want to change the virtual machine address, go to ClientAdapter.java and change the Host field.

âœ… If it runs smoothly, you will see one of the waiting page here:

âœ… Next, you can choose to play with your three other friends(let them run the clientUI as well), or play with the mock client
by running the command: 
```bash
./client_mock.sh
# Notice: In the file client_mock.sh, change "vcm-xxxxx.vm.duke.edu" to your own virtual machine name.
```

### 4.3. Player login

ðŸ”± 4.3.1. When all **4 players** have joined the game, the game will switch to the login page, which is one of the follows:

ðŸ”· Note: We didn't actually implement the functions of login pages, so users can input whatever they want in it.

ðŸ”± 4.3.2.  Wait for other clients to finish login. You will then automatically be assigned your house. Each player could be
randomly assigned to one of the four harry potter houses: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw or Slytheri, whose color is aligned with the territory color. After clicking the "I'm pleased to accept my offer", user will go into next stage.

### 4.4. Players' Unit Allocations

ðŸ”± 4.4.1. After all players input their names, there will be a display of game map as well as the text descriptions. There will be a prompt: **"Please enter the name of the territory you want to add units to:"**, and you should enter the alphabet representing the land you want to add units to; 

ðŸ”± 4.4.2. After that, there be a prompt of: **"Please enter the number of units you want to add(24 Remaining):"**, and you should just input a number for it. If you don't use up all 24 units, this prompt loop will keep going until you enter correctly.

ðŸ”± 4.4.3. After you finish all your territories' unit allocation, you will see the prompt: **"Total units placed: 24. You have placed exactly 24 units."** You should just wait for other clients to finish inputing their units.

### 4.5. Game Stage

ðŸ”± 4.5.1. The server sends maps to all the players and the game begins! All players can see the current turn number, as well as each player's unit allocation in this turn. 

ðŸ”± 4.5.2. There will be prompt: **"You: X(Your User Name), what would you like to do? (M)ove (A)ttack (D)oneâ€œ**.

Each player can choose to attack or move or commit orders, and they can do as many orders as they want in one turn as long as they have enough units.

ðŸ”´ **Note: After each order is placed, the map will be updated automatically. But this doesn't mean you have successfully executes this order. All orders are finalized on the server side.**

ðŸ”± 4.5.3. If the player choose to **Move**, then he/she should type in **"M"**; then the player should enter the name of territory he/she wants to move from, the name of territory he/she wants to move to, and the number of units he/she wants to move. 

ðŸ”± 4.5.4. If the player choose to **Attack**, then he/she should type in **"A"**; then the player should enter the name of territory he/she wants to attack from, the name of territory he/she wants to attack to, and the number of units he/she wants to use in attack. 

ðŸ”± 4.5.5. If the player thinks he/she can **Place Orders** in this turn, then he/she should type **"D"**. There be a prompt: **"Waiting for other players..."** indicating the player is in the waiting stage.

ðŸ”± 4.5.6. After all players have finished, the server will show: **"Received all action lists."**, and start the battling stage. It will print each battle info, demonstrating who is the winner of this battle. Then, a new turn begins.

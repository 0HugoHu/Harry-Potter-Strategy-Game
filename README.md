## 4. Tutorials

ðŸ’¡ For this evolution 2, you need to run **1 server** and **4 clients** (this is a fixed number at present). Each client will be assigned to one house according to the Harry Potter world setting: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw or Slytherin.

### 4.1. Start the Server

âœ… Run the server by command:
```bash
./gradlew :server:run
```
Wait for players to connect to the server. 

### 4.2. Start the Clients

âœ… To see the clientUI interface, run the clientUI configuration by clicking the triangle button.

âœ… If it runs smoothly, you will see this waiting page here:

âœ… Next, you can choose to play with your three other friends(let them run the clientUI as well), or play with the mock client
by running the command: 
```bash
./client_mock.sh
# Notice: In the file client_mock.sh, change "vcm-xxxxx.vm.duke.edu" to your own virtual machine name.
```


You then should see the prompt: **"Currently waiting for other players..."**.

ðŸ”± 4.3.1. When all **3 players** have joined the game, there should be a prompt: **"Please enter your player name:"** on the client side. Type in your user's name

ðŸ”± 4.3.2.  Wait for other clients to finish input their names. You will then automatically be assigned your game ID.

### 4.4. Players' Unit Allocations

ðŸ”± 4.4.1. After all players input their names, there will be a display of game map as well as the text descriptions. There will be a prompt: **"Please enter the name of the territory you want to add units to:"**, and you should enter the alphabet representing the land you want to add units to; 

ðŸ”± 4.4.2. After that, there be a prompt of: **"Please enter the number of units you want to add(24 Remaining):"**, and you should just input a number for it. If you don't use up all 24 units, this prompt loop will keep going until you enter correctly.

ðŸ”± 4.4.3. After you finish all your territories' unit allocation, you will see the prompt: **"Total units placed: 24. You have placed exactly 24 units."** You should just wait for other clients to finish inputing their units.

### 4.5. Game Stage

ðŸ”± 4.5.1. The server sends maps to all the players and the game begins! All players can see the current turn number, as well as each player's unit allocation in this turn.

Each player can choose to attack or move or commit orders, and they can do as many orders as they want in one turn as long as they have enough units.

ðŸ”´ **Note: After each order is placed, the map will be updated automatically. But this doesn't mean you have successfully executes this order. All orders are finalized on the server side.**

ðŸ”± 4.5.3. If the player choose to **Move**, then he/she should type in **"M"**; then the player should enter the name of territory he/she wants to move from, the name of territory he/she wants to move to, and the number of units he/she wants to move. 

ðŸ”± 4.5.4. If the player choose to **Attack**, then he/she should type in **"A"**; then the player should enter the name of territory he/she wants to attack from, the name of territory he/she wants to attack to, and the number of units he/she wants to use in attack. 

ðŸ”± 4.5.5. If the player thinks he/she can **Place Orders** in this turn, then he/she should type **"D"**. There be a prompt: **"Waiting for other players..."** indicating the player is in the waiting stage.

ðŸ”± 4.5.6. After all players have finished, the server will show: **"Received all action lists."**, and start the battling stage. It will print each battle info, demonstrating who is the winner of this battle. Then, a new turn begins.

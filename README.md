## 4. Tutorials

ðŸ’¡ For this evolution 2, you need to run **1 server** and **4 clients** (this is a fixed number at present). Each client will be assigned to one house according to the Harry Potter world setting: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw or Slytherin.

### 4.1. Start the Server

âœ… Run the server by command:
```bash
./gradlew :server:run
```
Wait for players to connect to the server. 

### 4.2. Start the Clients

âœ… To see the clientUI interface, run the clientUI configuration by clicking the triangle button.

If you want to change the virtual machine address, go to ClientAdapter.java and change the Host field.

âœ… If it runs smoothly, you will see one of the waiting page here:

âœ… Next, you can choose to play with your three other friends(let them run the clientUI as well), or play with the mock client
by running the command: 
```bash
./client_mock.sh
# Notice: In the file client_mock.sh, change "vcm-xxxxx.vm.duke.edu" to your own virtual machine name.
```

### 4.3. Player login

ðŸ”± 4.3.1. When all **4 players** have joined the game, the game will switch to the login page, which is one of the follows:

ðŸ”· Note: We didn't actually implement the functions of login pages, so users can input whatever they want in it.

ðŸ”± 4.3.2.  After all others have login, you will then automatically be assigned your house. Each player could be
randomly assigned to one of the four harry potter houses: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw or Slytheri, whose color is aligned with the territory color. After clicking the "I'm pleased to accept my offer", user will go into next stage.
